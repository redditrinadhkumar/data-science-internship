# Data Science Internship – February 2026

This repository contains all assignments completed as part of my Data Science Internship.

The internship focuses on strengthening core Python programming skills, logical thinking, data preprocessing techniques, validation systems, and foundational concepts required for real-world data analysis.

Each module demonstrates structured problem-solving, clean code practices, and practical applications inspired by industry scenarios such as authentication systems, academic evaluation systems, text validation, and log monitoring.

The repository is organized module-wise to ensure clarity, scalability, and professional project structure.
